   Diem is a project that was proposed by Facebook Inc. in 2018. It is intended to use blockchain technology to create a Digital payment system that is accessible and affordable for everyone. It is currently still under development and is reportedly set to launch to the public in January 2021 (Pymnts, 2019). The first media reports related to the launch of Diem were announced in June 2019 (Constine, 2019).

   Head of Facebook Financial,David Marcus, was formerly leading the Diem  project when it was first announced. In light of increasing regulatory scrutiny and the negative press and distrust surrounding Facebook and data privacy concerns, Stuart Levey, former Chief Legal Officer for HSBC Holdings, was appointed as CEO in May 2020 (Libra Association, 2020). This appointment was reported as a move to show that the Diem project is independent from Facebook, and an attempt to get regulatory approvals prior to launching  in January 2021 (Kastrenakes, 2020). Levey has extensive background in the regulatory environment having served in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and for implementing and enforcing all U.S. civil anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) (Libra Association, 2020).



**Origins of Diem**

   The idea for Diem stemmed from the grim reality that roughly 1.7 billion people in the world do not have access to banking infrastructure or financial services, despite many of them having a mobile phone (Spilka, 2020). Diem was created to provide a solution for a large proportion of this ‘unbanked’ population by enabling ‘instantaneous, low-cost, highly secure transactions’ outside of traditional banking and using blockchain technology (Kastrenakes, 2020). 

   Although Diem was proposed by Facebook, it is funded by an independent membership organization known as ‘The Diem Association’. The Association comprises of members from various businesses, nonprofit organizations and academic institutions distributed all around the world. The initial investment for funding and membership into the association is a minimum of US $10 million. Existing members include: Coinbase, Lyft, Shopify, and Uber Technologies, just to name a few. Facebook also has a stake, which is reported to be less than 10% of overall funding. Members also receive one voting right, enabling them to have decision-making power in how the project is being developed and executed, including overseeing and coordinating the technical design of the Diem network (libra.org, 2020). 


## Business Activities 

**The Diem Challenge and Solution**

   The goal of the Diem payment system (which includes the Diem cryptocurrency coin, digital wallet ‘Novi’ and blockchain) is to provide global access to safe and affordable financial services (Kastrenakes, 2020). According to the [Diem website](https://www.diem.com/en-us/), Diem is looking to solve the following financial problems:

- 1.7 billion people are currently ‘unbanked’ 
- For those who do have access to financial services, cross border payments are slow, taking an average 3-5 business days to complete
- Sending and receiving money internationally comes at a high cost (at an average cost of 7% per transaction of money sent) and these costs are higher for the poorer population  
- The world still runs on cash (85% of  global transactions use cash) 
- Cash can be hard to move and is prone to theft (U.S. retail business lose $40 billion annually) 


    The solution that Diem provides is intended to address a global audience, which is to provide financial inclusion, driven by the use of blockchain technology and digital financial services. Furthermore, according to its website, Diem was created based on the belief that “global, open, instant and low-cost payment networks create immense economic opportunities and more commerce across the world”(Diem White Paper, 2020). Although the system has not yet launched, their projected market size is estimated at 100-150 million users (Sandner, 2019). However, with increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, this number is expected to be larger upon launch.
